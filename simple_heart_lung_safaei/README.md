Here is a brief summary of my implementation about how the heart is connected with the lung. Two different methods are implemented to connect the heart with the lung. Firstly, some finite methods are utilized to solve some odes. It is implemented in Heart_Lung_FiniteMethods python code. Secondly, the scipy ode package is employed to solve these odes. The code regarding to this matter is in Heart_Lung_scipy python code. 
There are some packages  required to be installed with pip for Heart_Lung_FiniteMethods:
   1- Numpy 
   2- Matplotlib 
   3- Switch 
   4- Math 

To run the Heart_Lung_scipy, the following packages are required to be installed with pip (some of them are similar to Heart_Lung_FiniteMethods) 
   1- Numpy
   2- Matplotlib
   3- Switch
   4- Math
   5- Scipy
   


When python files are run, three inputs are requested from user to give as input:
   1- The first element of interval (I assume it is 0, but different can be considered) 
   2- The last element of interval (I assume it is 10, but different can be considered) 
   3- The number of splitting intervals (I assume it is 500, but different can be considered)
